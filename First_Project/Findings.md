Hi
I’m aspiring to understand Saudi Market from the data; therefore, I’m interested to find any open data that can highlight the opportunities in our local market.
As start, I found this data in Kaggle which’s about used car advertisements in Saudi Arabia. 
I heighlighed three points to focus on them and to adress them in the analysis.

- What's the largest year the used cars produced in? 
- Who's the largest car maker in the used car advertisement?
- Is the top proportion type of the used cars came from the largest car maker?
