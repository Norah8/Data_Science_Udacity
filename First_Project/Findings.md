Hi
I’m aspiring to understand Saudi Market from the data; therefore, I’m interested to find any open data that can highlight our local market.
As start, I found this data in Kaggle, scraping from website which’s about used car advertisements in Saudi Arabia. 

I heighlighed three points to focus on them in the analysis.

- When the used cars in the website made? 
- Who's the largest car manufacturer in these advertisement?
- What's the price range in the used cars? can be reach to million or half million?


But wait, the price is negotiable in more than 25% of the used car ads!!

It's interesting to know what's the most car negotiable?

It looks there're old cars in the website from 2013 but are there older than that ?


# Sprisingly there're 255 cars older than 2000 , The older car was made in 1936 which is Jaguar

But you know the common most older car is Suburban from 1999

Back to our first main question:
It appears most cars in the website from 2016, 2015 and 2017:

And as I guess most used cars from Toyota :)

Excluding ads that are negotiable , the price range of Toyota, started from 850 and it reached to 350,000:

To highlight the top car that's not negotiable, Accent from Hyundai comes first:

And I know you have the question I have, Is there used car in the website more than 1 million?

# Yes, there's one car which's Mercedes, its price 1,150,000 

let'us go down what's the used cars that's more than half million?

It looks the price variation is large in Mercedes and Bentley, while it appears the prices didn't effect too much by the available options in the cars.
