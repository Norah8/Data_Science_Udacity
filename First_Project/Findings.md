Hi
I’m aspiring to understand Saudi Market from the data; therefore, I’m interested to find any open data that can highlight our local market.
As start, I found this data in Kaggle, scraping from website which’s about used car advertisements in Saudi Arabia. 

I heighlighed three points to focus on them in the analysis.

- When the used cars in the website made? 
- Who's the largest car maker in these advertisement?
- What's the price range in the used cars? can be reach to million or half million?


But wait, the price is negotiable in more than 25% of the used car ads!!

It's interesting to know what's the most car negotiable?

It looks there're old cars in the website from 2013 but are there older than that ?


# Sprisingly there're 255 cars older than 2000 , The older car was made in 1936 which is Jaguar

But you know the common most older car is Suburban from 1999

Back to our main question:
It appears most cars in the website from 2016, 2015 and 2017:

And as I guess most used cars from Toyota :)

Excluding ads that are negotiable , the price range of Toyota from 2018, started from 850 and it reached to 350,000:

To highlight the top car that's not negotiable, Accent from Hyundai comes first:

And I know you have the question I have, Is there used car in the website more than 1 million?

# Yes, there's one car which's Mercedes, its price 1,150,000 

let'us go down what's the used cars that's more than half million?
