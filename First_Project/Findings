Hi
I’m aspiring to understand Saudi Market from the data; therefore, I’m interested to find any open data that can highlight the opportunities in our local market. As start, I found this data in Kaggle which’s about used car advertisements in Saudi Arabia.
-	What’s the most used car for selling?
-	What’s the important feature that affect the price?
