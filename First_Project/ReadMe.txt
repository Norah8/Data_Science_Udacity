This project for the first project in Data Science Nanodegree. I'm interested in Saudi Market, so I chose something related to it.
It's about used cars' ads from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/turkibintalib/saudi-arabia-used-cars-dataset
The libraries used: 
- pandas
- NumPy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
The code here: used_cars_in_ksa.ipynb
Summary of the result:
- There's a big percentage of the ads is price negotiable.
- The manufactured year of used cars started from 1936 to 2021.
- Toyota comes first as the most ads from it and Camry, Land Cruiser come on the top type from this company.
