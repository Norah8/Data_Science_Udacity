This project for the first project in Data Science Nanodegree. I'm interested in Saudi Market so I choose something related to it.
It's about used cars' ads from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/turkibintalib/saudi-arabia-used-cars-dataset
The libraries used: 
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
